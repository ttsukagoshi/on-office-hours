窓口時間（オフィスアワー）内・外でGoogle Apps Script（GAS）を実行させたい時のフレームワーク。スクリプトは土日祝日が休みとなる日本の企業を想定しているものの、「休日」の定義さえ調整すればあらゆるケースに対応可能。

A framework for executing triggered functions on Google Apps Script based on the user's office hours. The script is a sample made based on the assumption that the user is based in Japan and that their office hours are on the weekdays, but the basic idea can be applied to all kinds of office hours.
